# Scope Interview Checklist

## Goal and Outcome

- What business or user outcome must this solve?
- How will we know this is successful?
- What happens if we do nothing?

## Users and Flow

- Who is the primary user?
- What exact flow changes for that user?
- What edge cases are required in v1?

## Constraints

- What is the deadline or latest acceptable delivery date?
- What team capacity is available?
- What tech constraints are fixed (stack, infra, APIs, legal, security)?

## Quality Bar

- What reliability/performance/security requirements are non-negotiable?
- What test level is required before release?
- What observability/logging is mandatory?

## Scope Boundaries

- Which capabilities are must-have in first release?
- Which capabilities are explicitly postponed?
- What is explicitly out-of-scope?

## Decision Prompts

- "Hvis vi kun må levere 20% af løsningen nu, hvad skal med?"
- "Hvad er den dyreste misforståelse i denne opgave?"
- "Hvilke antagelser skal bekræftes før implementering?"
